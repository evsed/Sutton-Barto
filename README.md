# Sutton-Barto
Contains solutions to the problems from the Sutton & Barto's book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" (2 ed.); 
I also try to replicate all figures from the book and provide more extensive comments on the rigorous theory
behind some of the results, especially concerning asymtotic properties of algorithms. 
I will update repository as I go through the material in the book.
